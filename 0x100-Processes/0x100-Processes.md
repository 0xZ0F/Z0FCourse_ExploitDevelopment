# 0x100 - Processes
Let's start with finding information about processes such as their ID's, location in memory, etc. Throughout this course the two main libraries we will use are `Windows.h` and `TlHelp32.h`. Both of these will give us functions and types that we will need. For example, the type `DWORD` is defined in `Windows.h` and the type `PROCESSENTRY32` is defined in `TlHelp32.h`.
